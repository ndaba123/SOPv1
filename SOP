Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Scalable Cake Baking for Any Number of People
Transcript:
You can bake a cake for any number of people by following three actions. First, determine how many people you will serve. Next, measure ingredients using a simple scaling rule. Finally, mix and bake the cake at one consistent temperature.
Step 1: Determine Required Cake Size
Multiply the number of people by 130 grams to calculate total batter required.
Decision Point:
If you do not have a scale, use one standard 9-inch round or 9×13-inch pan for approximately 1,300 grams of batter.
Step 2: Measure Ingredients
Use equal amounts of sugar, fat, and liquid. Use twice that amount of flour.
Use sugar, butter or oil, milk, flour, eggs, baking powder, salt, and optional vanilla.
Decision Point:
If dietary restrictions apply, substitute ingredients before mixing.
Step 3: Mix the Batter
Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease the pan. Mix fat and sugar until creamy. Add eggs one at a time. Mix dry ingredients separately. Alternate adding dry ingredients and liquid. Stop mixing once the batter becomes smooth.
Decision Point:
If the batter looks dry, add liquid one tablespoon at a time.
Step 4: Bake the Cake
Fill pans no more than two-thirds full. Bake at 350°F (175°C).
Decision Point:
If the cake springs back and a toothpick comes out clean, remove it from the oven. If not, continue baking in 5-minute intervals.
Bake for 25–30 minutes for thin layers or 40–55 minutes for thick cakes.
Step 5: Cool and Serve
Cool the cake in the pan for 10–15 minutes. Remove from the pan and cool completely. Serve plain or frost.
1. Purpose Statement
This document defines a repeatable and scalable procedure for baking a cake that serves any number of people.
2. Scope
Who: Home bakers, students, instructors, and experienced cooks.
What: Baking a scalable cake using proportional ingredient ratios.
When: Any situation requiring a flexible cake recipe.
3. Roles and Responsibilities
Baker / Operator: Determines quantities, mixes ingredients, bakes, and evaluates doneness.
Instructor / Reviewer: Verifies correct application of the procedure.
4. Inputs and Outputs
Inputs: Number of people, ingredients, baking equipment, oven.
Outputs: Finished cake sized appropriately for the group.
6. Exceptions and Known Rework Scenarios
Overmixed batter produces dense cake. Undercooked cake requires additional baking. Overfilled pans cause overflow and require batter removal.
7. Prompt Log and Generation Traceability

AI Output: Generated SOP in Word document format while including original document contents. (AI-as-an-editor)
Edits Applied: Normalized terminology, resolved temperature inconsistencies, and formatted content into SOP structure.

Glossary / Data Dictionary
Batter: Unbaked mixture of cake ingredients.
Fat: Butter or oil that provides moisture and structure.
Scaling Rule: Formula that adjusts ingredient quantities based on servings.
Doneness: Condition where the cake finishes baking and is ready to remove.
Decision Point: Step requiring evaluation before proceeding.
Change Log / Summary of Revisions
The following changes were made to improve clarity, usability, and consistency while maintaining the original structure, formatting, and intent of the SOP.
1. Simplified step-by-step baking instructions into short, action-oriented statements written in active voice.
2. Added clearly labeled Decision Points to indicate where the baker must evaluate conditions before proceeding.
3. Standardized baking temperature to 350°F (175°C) for consistency across all steps.
4. Removed ambiguous or repetitive phrasing and corrected grammatical issues.
5. Clarified ingredient scaling rules to reduce calculation errors.
6. Added a Glossary / Data Dictionary to define key terms used throughout the SOP.
7. Improved consistency in terminology across transcript, procedure, and exception sections.
8. Maintained original section headers, order, and professional SOP formatting.
