    A([Start]) --> B[Step 1: Determine Required Cake Size]
    B --> C[Multiply the number of people by 130 grams to calculate total batter required]
    C --> D{Do you have a scale?}
    D -- Yes --> E[Step 2: Measure Ingredients]
    D -- No --> F[Use one standard 9-inch round or 9×13-inch pan for approximately 1,300 grams of batter]
    F --> E
    E --> G[Use equal amounts of sugar, fat, and liquid]
    G --> H[Use twice that amount of flour]
    H --> I[Use sugar, butter or oil, milk, flour, eggs, baking powder, salt, and optional vanilla]
    I --> J{Do dietary restrictions apply?}
    J -- Yes --> K[Substitute ingredients before mixing]
    J -- No --> L[Step 3: Mix the Batter]
    K --> L
    L --> M[Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C)]
    M --> N[Grease the pan]
    N --> O[Mix fat and sugar until creamy]
    O --> P[Add eggs one at a time]
    P --> Q[Mix dry ingredients separately]
    Q --> R[Alternate adding dry ingredients and liquid]
    R --> S[Stop mixing once the batter becomes smooth]
    S --> T{Does the batter look dry?}
    T -- Yes --> U[Add liquid one tablespoon at a time]
    T -- No --> V[Step 4: Bake the Cake]
    U --> V
    V --> W[Fill pans no more than two-thirds full]
    W --> X[Bake at 350°F (175°C)]
    X --> Y{Does the cake spring back and does a toothpick come out clean?}
    Y -- Yes --> Z[Remove it from the oven]
    Y -- No --> AA[Continue baking in 5-minute intervals]
    AA --> Y
    Z --> AB[Bake for 25–30 minutes for thin layers or 40–55 minutes for thick cakes]
    AB --> AC[Step 5: Cool and Serve]
    AC --> AD[Cool the cake in the pan for 10–15 minutes]
    AD --> AE[Remove from the pan and cool completely]
    AE --> AF[Serve plain or frost]
